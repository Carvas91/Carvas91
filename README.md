👋 Hi there! I'm Carlos (@Carvas91), a Python 🐍 and AI enthusiast based in Mississauga, Canada 🇨🇦. I recently completed my Master’s in Artificial Intelligence, with a thesis on comparing machine learning techniques for BMI prediction in the Ecuadorian population using sociodemographic data.

I’m passionate about solving real-world problems through AI and data science. I love working with Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn, building machine learning models, and diving into SQL and Power BI to uncover insights.

In my free time, I enjoy working out, playing guitar, and expanding my skills through Udemy courses on emerging technologies. If you’re into AI, data science, or cool tech projects, let’s connect! 😊
