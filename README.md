👋 Hi there! I'm Carlos (@Carvas91).

🎓 I'm currently working on my Master's thesis in Artificial Intelligence, focusing on comparing machine learning techniques for predicting BMI categories in the Ecuadorian population using sociodemographic variables.

🐍 I have a passion for Python, especially for data analysis and visualization using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. I'm also proficient with SQL and have experience with Power BI. Additionally, I work with machine learning and deep learning, using libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn to build and refine models.
